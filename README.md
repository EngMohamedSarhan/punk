## Punk

This is a sample React-Native project of two screens. <br />
This project is tested only on Android. <br />
The project is based on this [design](https://www.uplabs.com/posts/grocery-app-ios-mobile-ui-kits-food-delivery-app), also I don't have access to the design assets, and I updated the design in product screen by not hiding the tab bar for accessibility. <br />
